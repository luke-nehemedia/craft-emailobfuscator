## Requirements

This plugin is made for Craft CMS 3.0.0-beta.23 or later.
It requires the [Email-Obfuscator by Propaganistas](https://github.com/Propaganistas/Email-Obfuscator) since this plugin is merely a wrapper for his Twig Extension.

## Installation

To install the plugin, follow these instructions.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require lucasbares/craft-emailobfuscator

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Craft Emailobfuscator.

You can also update your craft's `composer.json` file and run `composer update`. 

## Using the Plugin

This plugin adds the Twig Extension made by [Propaganistas](https://github.com/Propaganistas/Email-Obfuscator) to Craft. It masks all email addresses by ROT13 ciphering or CSS reverse text direction. A simple javascript file decodes the masked emails on the frontend.

To use it, just use the `obfuscateEmail` Twig filter on any text field or string:

```twig
{{ "Sample Text"|obfuscateEmail }}
{{ textfield|obfuscateEmail }}
```

## Configuring the Plugin
### InludeJS
By default the plugin inserts the necessary JavaScript to your front end html. There is a setting to turn this off if you want to include the JS code manually. The relevant JS code is available at https://github.com/Propaganistas/Email-Obfuscator/tree/master/assets
